# Bird Brain: A Digital Journal for Bird Nerds!

## User Story

AS AN avid bird watcher/enthusiast
I WANT an app to help me record, log and share my bird finds
SO THAT all my discoveries can be saved and in one place and others can see my finds

## Walkthrough Video/Screenshots

## Description

This is a command line app for compiling, creating, sharing, and editing all your bird sightings! We have made the interface simple and intuitive so that anyone can hop on and record events/sightings quickly and easily, saving more time to get back out for more bird watching. Sighting logs can be as sparse as a date/location/bird sighted, or detailed with pictures, tags, weather, etc. Bird watching can be more of an introspective activity that is perfect for journaling, and an avid bird watcher would definitely benefit from having visual records of what they’ve seen the previous morning or the previous year. We strived to create an app with a focus on real world usability. From the forecast banner up top to the image/file uploading to the searchable bird database, we looked at every element and asked “does this make the app easier/ more convenient to use?”

GIVEN I visit the app
WHEN I am on the homepage
THEN I am shown a simple layout where I can either log in or create a new account
WHEN I log in or make an account
THEN I have the ability to search for any bird to get data, or I can fill out all the data myself in the text fields
WHEN I log in or make an account
THEN I have forecast data for the upcoming week to help me plan my next bird watch outing
WHEN I click the “upload file” or the “upload image” buttons
THEN I will have my images or a sound recording of the bird I saw
WHEN I click “submit”
THEN I have a recorded sighting that I can reference/ edit/ delete later if I choose
