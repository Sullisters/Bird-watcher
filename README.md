# Bird Brain: A Digital Journal for Bird Nerds!

## User Story

AS AN avid bird watcher/enthusiast
I WANT an app to help me record, log and share my bird finds
SO THAT all my discoveries can be saved and in one place and others can see my finds

## Walkthrough Video/Screenshots

## Description

This is a command line app for compiling, creating, sharing, and editing all your bird sightings! We have made the interface simple and intuitive so that anyone can hop on and record events/sightings quickly and easily, saving more time to get back out for more bird watching. Sighting logs can be as sparse as a date/location/bird sighted, or detailed with pictures, tags, weather, etc. We hope you enjoy our journal app.

## Usage

1. Open your command line interface
2. Run "npm i" to install packages
3. Log in to your Mysql and run "SOURCE db/schema.sql, then exit your Mysql
4. Run "npm run seed"
5. Run "nodemon" for your local host to dynamically update
6. Go to your local host to visit the site
7. Either use an existing account to log in, or create a new account
8. Fill the empty fields to record a sighting, and upload a picture of the sighting if you want
9. View your previous sightings, image uploads, delete a sighting you don't want, check upcoming local weather
10. Log out when finished
